# CleaningDataProject
Project week 3 for Getting and cleaning data course (coursera)


### Introduction

In this project, we have to clean different files of data and prepare a tidy data for analysis. 

The data have been collected from an accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S Smartphone (Human Activity Recognition). 


### The files

wWe have multiple files coming with the data that we need to integrate. First, we have to kind of data: training and testing, and we have common files containing labels for variables. Here is the list of data:

Training:
1. X_train (the measures)
2. Y_train (the activity of this measure)
3. subject_train (the ID of the subject)

Test:
1. X_test
2. Y_test
3. subject_test

Common:
1. Activity_labels (description of the activity)
2. features (the kind of measures)

We will integrate all the data. We will not use the inertial signals files.
